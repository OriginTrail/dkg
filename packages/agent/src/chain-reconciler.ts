/**
 * Phase B — chain-driven VM reconciliation orchestration (B.2 sweep + B.4 driver).
 *
 * This is the engine that turns "chain says a KC was registered to a CG" into
 * "that KC is in my VM", built on the per-CG registration-ordinal cursor
 * (`reconcile-cursor.ts`). It is intentionally a thin, side-effect-injected
 * orchestrator so the sweep + watermark + coalescing logic is unit-testable
 * without a chain / libp2p / store harness — the agent supplies the real
 * `reconcileOrdinal` (chain reads + active fetch + `handleChainReconciledKC`)
 * and persistence.
 *
 * The design (settled by the B.0 spike + review):
 *   * **Sweep-driven, not event-driven.** A live `KnowledgeAssetRegisteredToContextGraph`
 *     event is only a low-latency *nudge* to run the sweep for that CG now — it
 *     does not carry the ordinal, so it is never treated as a cursor position.
 *     The periodic/startup sweep is the safety net that guarantees eventual
 *     reconciliation even if a live event was missed or a fetch transiently
 *     failed.
 *   * **Contiguous watermark.** Out-of-order completions are held in the cursor's
 *     `ahead` set until the gap below them fills; the watermark only advances
 *     over a contiguous, confirmation-depth-buried run (see `reconcile-cursor.ts`).
 *   * **Coalesced per CG.** A burst of N events for one CG triggers ONE sweep,
 *     with a single trailing re-run if more events land mid-sweep.
