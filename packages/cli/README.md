# @origintrail-official/dkg

Command-line interface and daemon for DKG V10. This is the main entry point for running a DKG node — it manages the node lifecycle, exposes a local HTTP API, and provides commands for publishing, querying, and interacting with the network.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @origintrail-official/dkg
```

On supported platforms, the package performs a best-effort postinstall fetch of
the standalone MarkItDown converter into the package `bin/` directory so PDF,
DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, HTML, EPUB, and XML imports work without a separate
system-level install.

**From source** (monorepo development):

```bash
pnpm build
cd packages/cli && node ./scripts/bundle-markitdown-binaries.mjs --build-current-platform
pnpm link --global --filter @origintrail-official/dkg

# Binary is now available as `dkg`
dkg --help
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new node (generates keys, sets up config)
dkg init

# Start the node daemon
dkg start

# Check node status
dkg status

# Create a context graph (project), write RDF, promote to SWM, publish to VM
dkg context-graph create my-project
dkg assertion import-file notes -f data.md -c my-project
dkg assertion promote notes -c my-project
dkg shared-memory publish my-project

# Query the knowledge graph
dkg query my-project -q "SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10"
```

## Source Workers

`dkg source-worker run --config <path>` runs a generic polling worker from a
JSON config file. Treat that config as sensitive operator material, equivalent
to the daemon's `auth.token`: it contains `daemonToken` and names a
`handlerModule` that the CLI dynamically imports and executes in the worker
process. Store it with the same access controls as `auth.token`, and do not
commit it to a repository.

Handler modules export `createSourceWorkerDeps(context)`, returning
`getFingerprint` and `processSource`. `getFingerprint(source)` is the content
identity contract for the worker: source content changes that affect emitted
triples/assets must produce a different fingerprint, while unchanged source
content must keep the same fingerprint across runs. Do not include wall-clock
time, random values, transient job status, or other polling noise in the
fingerprint.

Minimal config shape:

```json
{
  "pollIntervalMs": 60000,
  "stateFile": "./state/source-worker.json",
  "daemonUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:9200",
  "daemonToken": "<contents of auth.token>",
  "handlerModule": "./handlers/source-worker.mjs",
  "handlerExport": "sourceWorker",
  "sources": [{ "id": "source-1" }]
}
```

The handler module is loaded from the config file's directory:

```js
export const sourceWorker = {
  createSourceWorkerDeps({ sharedMemory, asyncLift }) {
    return {
      async getFingerprint(source) {
        return source.contentHash;
      },
      async processSource(source, fingerprint) {
        const share = await sharedMemory.share(source.contextGraphId, source.quads);
        const jobId = await asyncLift.lift({
          ...source.liftRequest,
          shareOperationId: share.shareOperationId
        });
        return {
          sourceId: source.id,
          skipped: false,
          jobIds: [jobId],
          jobStatuses: { [jobId]: "queued" },
          status: "queued",
          nextState: {
            fingerprint,
            lastStatus: "queued",
            lastJobIds: [jobId],
            lastJobStatuses: { [jobId]: "queued" }
          }
        };
      },
    };
  },
};
```

The worker state file is updated with a same-directory temp-file write, file
fsync, atomic rename, and parent-directory fsync where supported so a crash does
not truncate the previous state file.

## HTTP API

When the daemon is running, it exposes a local HTTP API (default: `http://localhost:9200`). Key endpoint groups:

- `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/info` — node status and health
- `POST /api/agent/register`, `GET /api/agent/identity` — agent identity
- `POST /api/context-graph/create`, `/register`, `/invite`, `GET /api/context-graph/list` — context graph management
- `POST /api/assertion/create`, `/{name}/write`, `/{name}/promote`, `/{name}/discard`, `/{name}/import-file`, `GET /api/assertion/{name}/history` — Working Memory assertions
- `POST /api/shared-memory/write`, `/publish` — Shared Working Memory and publishing to Verified Memory
- `POST /api/query`, `POST /api/query-remote` — SPARQL querying
- `POST /api/endorse`, `POST /api/verify`, `POST /api/update` — Verified Memory trust operations
- `GET /api/peers`, `GET /api/connections`, `GET /api/agents` — network introspection
- `GET /api/wallets/balances`, `GET /api/chain/rpc-health` — wallet and chain health
- `GET /api/events` — Server-Sent Events stream for real-time notifications

> The V9 `GET /api/apps` endpoint (and the `/apps/*` iframe host) was retired in
> V10 along with the installable apps framework — the daemon now returns
> `410 Gone` on those paths. See [Extending the Node](#extending-the-node) below.

All endpoints (except public paths like `/api/status`, `/api/chain/rpc-health`, and `/.well-known/skill.md`) require an API token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

The full API surface — including request bodies, response shapes, and error codes — is documented in [`skills/dkg-node/SKILL.md`](./skills/dkg-node/SKILL.md).

## Local Benchmarks

The live publish/get benchmark measures four operation timings against a running
DKG daemon: synchronous publish end-to-end latency, async publisher enqueue
latency, async job completion/finalization latency, and SPARQL get latency for
the published benchmark content.

Prerequisites:

- Start a node with `dkg start`.
- Use a context graph that is safe for benchmark writes and publish costs.
- Ensure the async publisher is enabled when measuring async completion:
  `dkg publisher enable`.
- For local daemon targets, use normal discovery or `DKG_API_PORT`; the command
  loads the local auth token from `DKG_HOME`. For non-loopback `--api-url`
  targets, pass `--auth-token` or `DKG_AUTH_TOKEN` explicitly.

Run from the repository after building the CLI package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @origintrail-official/dkg build
```

```bash
pnpm --filter @origintrail-official/dkg benchmark:publish-async-get -- \
  --context-graph-id my-project \
  --repeat 30 \
  --warmups 3 \
  --payload-size 10kb \
  --output-format json
```

Useful environment variables mirror the flags: `DKG_BENCH_CONTEXT_GRAPH_ID`,
`DKG_BENCH_REPEAT`, `DKG_BENCH_WARMUPS`, `DKG_BENCH_TIMEOUT_MS`,
`DKG_BENCH_PAYLOAD_SIZE`, `DKG_BENCH_FIXTURE`, `DKG_BENCH_OUTPUT_FORMAT`,
`DKG_BENCH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, `DKG_API_PORT`, `DKG_API_URL`, and
`DKG_AUTH_TOKEN`.

`--payload-size` and `DKG_BENCH_PAYLOAD_SIZE` accept raw bytes or generated-size
labels such as `10kb`, `100kb`, `2mb`, and `200mb`. The repository ESBench suite
uses those four generated sizes by default.

The output includes per-operation timing records and summary rows for
`syncPublish`, `asyncEnqueue`, `asyncCompletion`, and `get`. Each summary reports
count, success count, failure count, min, max, mean, median/p50, and p95. Failure
records include operation, iteration, error message, root entity, marker, context
graph, and a reproduction command. Warmups are excluded from summaries.

The repository-level ESBench workflow for this same benchmark feature is
documented in `BENCHMARKING.md`. It uses a deterministic layered DKG client, not
a live daemon, so the generated reports avoid auth tokens and local node paths.
`pnpm bench:html` writes the combined ESBench report plus one focused HTML page
for each benchmark flow and payload size. The full default matrix includes the
`200mb` scene; set `DKG_ESBENCH_PAYLOAD_SIZES=10kb` or another comma-separated
subset while doing quick local smoke checks:

- get/read retrieval
- synchronous publish with finalization
- asynchronous publish enqueue and finalization
- upload payload to local working memory
- lift local working memory to shared working memory

## Extending the Node

The V9 "installable apps" framework (iframe-hosted third-party UIs loaded from
`node_modules` with a `dkgApp` manifest) was retired in V10 to shrink the
security surface and simplify the daemon. The supported extension surface is now
the `dkg integration` CLI (see `packages/cli/src/integrations/`), which installs
trusted `cli` / `mcp` integrations from a registry with npm provenance
verification.
